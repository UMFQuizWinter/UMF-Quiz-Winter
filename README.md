# Sesiune Smasher

## Very important stuff!

### How to add new subject to website: 
1. Create a spreadsheet where people solve the questions.
2. After having a complete spreadsheet, export it as csv.
3. Run it in generator.py, where it will transform it into a well written json.
4. Format the json preferably using a web tool (for better visualization)
5. Add the new json file to the public folder (for localhost testing)
6. Add the new json file to the build folder
7. Add route to the subject in the App.js file

It should be working!
